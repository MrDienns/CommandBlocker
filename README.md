# CommandDeleter
CommandDeleter is a simple, yet extremely effective way of disabling/blocking commands in your server. What makes this
plugin better than others is the fact that it deletes the entire command from the server instead of trying to prevent
people from executing them. On top of that, it's able to detect whether a command has secret aliases, and it deletes
those too. We block the entire command functionality instead of blocking the command string. No more will people use
tons of aliases, which you aren't aware of, to still execute commands!
